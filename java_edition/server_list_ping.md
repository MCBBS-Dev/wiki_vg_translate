# 服务器列表Ping

Server List Ping (SLP) is an interface provided by Minecraft servers which supports querying the MOTD, player count, max players and server version via the usual port. SLP is part of the Protocol, but it can be disabled. The Notchian client uses this interface to display the multiplayer server list, hence the name. The SLP process changed in 1.7 in a non-backwards compatible way, but current servers still support both the new and old process.
