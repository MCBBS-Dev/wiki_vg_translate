## Definitions

The Minecraft server accepts connections from TCP clients and
communicates with them using *packets*. A packet is a sequence of bytes
sent over the TCP connection. The meaning of a packet depends both on
its packet ID and the current state of the connection. The initial state
of each connection is [Handshaking](#Handshaking "wikilink"), and state
is switched using the packets [Handshake](#Handshake "wikilink") and
[Login Success](#Login_Success "wikilink").

## Packet format {#packet_format}

Packets cannot be larger than 2^21^ − 1 or 2097151 bytes (the maximum
that can be sent in a 3-byte VarInt). For compressed packets, this
applies to both the compressed length and uncompressed lengths.

### Without compression {#without_compression}

  Field Name   Field Type   Notes
  ------------ ------------ -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Length       VarInt       Length of Packet ID + Data
  Packet ID    VarInt       
  Data         Byte Array   Depends on the connection state and packet ID, see the sections below

### With compression {#with_compression}

Once a [Set Compression](#Set_Compression "wikilink") packet (with a
non-negative threshold) is sent, [zlib](wikipedia:Zlib "wikilink")
compression is enabled for all following packets. The format of a packet
changes slightly to include the size of the uncompressed packet.

  Compressed?   Field Name      Field Type   Notes
  ------------- --------------- ------------ -------------------------------------------------------------------
  No            Packet Length   VarInt       Length of (Data Length) + Compressed length of (Packet ID + Data)
  No            Data Length     VarInt       Length of uncompressed (Packet ID + Data) or 0
  Yes           Packet ID       VarInt       zlib compressed packet ID (see the sections below)
                Data            Byte Array   zlib compressed packet data (see the sections below)

If the size of the buffer containing the packet data and ID (as a
VarInt) is smaller than the threshold specified in the packet [Set
Compression](#Set_Compression "wikilink"). It will be sent as
uncompressed. This is done by setting the data length as 0. (Comparable
to sending a non-compressed format with an extra 0 between the length,
and packet data).

If it\'s larger than the threshold, then it follows the regular
compressed protocol format.

Compression can be disabled by sending the packet [Set
Compression](#Set_Compression "wikilink") with a negative Threshold, or
not sending the Set Compression packet at all.

## Handshaking

### Clientbound

There are no clientbound packets in the Handshaking state, since the
protocol immediately switches to a different state after the client
sends the first packet.

### Serverbound

#### Handshake

This causes the server to switch into the target state.

Note that SRV records are a simple redirect, e.g. if \_minecraft.\_tcp.example.com points to mc.example.org, users connecting to example.com will provide example.org as server address in addition to connecting to it.

#### Legacy Server List Ping {#legacy_server_list_ping}

```{=mediawiki}
{{Warning|This packet uses a nonstandard format. It is never length-prefixed, and the packet ID is an Unsigned Byte instead of a VarInt.}}
```
While not technically part of the current protocol, legacy clients may
send this packet to initiate [Server List
Ping](Server_List_Ping "wikilink"), and modern servers should handle it
correctly. The format of this packet is a remnant of the pre-Netty age,
before the switch to Netty in 1.7 brought the standard format that is
recognized now. This packet merely exists to inform legacy clients that
they can\'t join our modern server.

  0x01        Status   Server     Payload      Long         May be any number. Notchian clients use a system-dependent time value which is counted in milliseconds.

## Login

The login process is as follows:

1.  C→S: [Handshake](#Handshake "wikilink") with Next State set to 2
    (login)
2.  C→S: [Login Start](#Login_Start "wikilink")
3.  S→C: [Encryption Request](#Encryption_Request "wikilink")
4.  Client auth
5.  C→S: [Encryption Response](#Encryption_Response "wikilink")
6.  Server auth, both enable encryption
7.  S→C: [Set Compression](#Set_Compression "wikilink") (optional)
8.  S→C: [Login Success](#Login_Success "wikilink")

Set Compression, if present, must be sent before Login Success. Note
that anything sent after Set Compression must use the [Post Compression
packet format](#With_compression "wikilink").

For unauthenticated (\"cracked\"/offline-mode) and integrated servers
(either of the two conditions is enough for an unencrypted connection)
there is no encryption. In that case [Login
Start](#Login_Start "wikilink") is directly followed by [Login
Success](#Login_Success "wikilink"). The Notchian server uses UUID v3
for offline player UUIDs, with the namespace "OfflinePlayer" and the
value as the player's username. For example, Notch's offline UUID would
be derived from the string "OfflinePlayer:Notch". This is not a
requirement however, the UUID may be anything.

See [Protocol Encryption](Protocol_Encryption "wikilink") for details.

                                                        Signature   

This packet switches the connection state to [play](#Play "wikilink").

```{=mediawiki}
{{Warning2|The (notchian) server might take a bit to fully transition to the Play state, so it's recommended to wait for the [[#Login (play)|Login (play)]] packet from the server.

The notchian client doesn't send any packets until the [[#Login (play)|Login (play)]] packet.
}}
```
#### Set Compression {#set_compression}

Enables compression. If compression is enabled, all following packets
are encoded in the [compressed packet
format](#With_compression "wikilink"). Negative values will disable
compression, meaning the packet format should remain in the
[uncompressed packet format](#Without_compression "wikilink"). However,
this packet is entirely optional, and if not sent, compression will also
not be enabled (the notchian server does not send the packet when
compression is disabled).

#### Login Plugin Request {#login_plugin_request}

Used to implement a custom handshaking flow together with [Login Plugin
Response](#Login_Plugin_Response "wikilink").

Unlike plugin messages in \"play\" mode, these messages follow a
lock-step request/response scheme, where the client is expected to
respond to a request indicating whether it understood. The notchian
client always responds that it hasn\'t understood, and sends an empty
payload.

## Play

### Clientbound {#clientbound_3}

#### Bundle Delimiter {#bundle_delimiter}

The delimeter for a bundle of packets. When received, the client should
store every subsequent packet it receives, and wait until another
delimiter is received. Once that happens, the client is guaranteed to
process every packet in the bundle on the same tick.

The Notchian client doesn\'t allow more than 4096 packets in the same
bundle.

#### Spawn Player {#spawn_player}

This packet is sent by the server when a player comes into visible
range, *not* when a player joins.

This packet must be sent after the [Player Info
Update](#Player_Info_Update "wikilink") packet that adds the player data
for the client to use when spawning a player. If the Player Info for the
player spawned by this packet is not present when this packet arrives,
Notchian clients will not spawn the player entity. The Player Info
packet includes skin/cape data.

Servers can, however, safely spawn player entities for players not in
visible range. The client appears to handle it correctly.

`{{Minecraft Wiki|Server.properties#online-mode|online mode}}`{=mediawiki},
the UUIDs must be valid and have valid skin blobs. In offline mode,
[UUID
v3](Wikipedia:Universally_unique_identifier#Versions_3_and_5_(namespace_name-based) "wikilink")
is used with the String `OfflinePlayer:<player name>`, encoded in UTF-8
(and case-sensitive). The Notchian server uses `UUID.nameUUIDFromBytes`,
implemented by OpenJDK
[here](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-jdk8u/blob/9a91972c76ddda5c1ce28b50ca38cbd8a30b7a72/jdk/src/share/classes/java/util/UUID.java#L153-L175).

For NPCs UUID v2 should be used. Note:

`<+Grum> i will never confirm this as a feature you know that :)`

In an example UUID, `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-Yxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`, the UUID
version is specified by `Y`. So, for UUID v3, `Y` will always be `3`,
and for UUID v2, `Y` will always be `2`.

#### Acknowledge Block Change {#acknowledge_block_change}

Acknowledges a user-initiated block change. After receiving this packet,
the client will display the block state sent by the server instead of
the one predicted by the client.

  ----------- ------- ---------- ------------- ------------ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  0x06        Play    Client     Sequence ID   VarInt       Represents the sequence to acknowledge, this is used for properly syncing block changes to the client after interactions.

#### Set Block Destroy Stage {#set_block_destroy_stage}

0--9 are the displayable destroy stages and each other number means that
there is no animation on this coordinate.

Block break animations can still be applied on air; the animation will
remain visible although there is no block being broken. However, if this
is applied to a transparent block, odd graphical effects may happen,
including water losing its transparency. (An effect similar to this can
be seen in normal gameplay when breaking ice blocks)

If you need to display several break animations at the same time you
have to give each of them a unique Entity ID. The entity ID does not
need to correspond to an actual entity on the client. It is valid to use
a randomly generated number.

#### Block Action {#block_action}

This packet is used for a number of actions and animations performed by
blocks, usually non-persistent. The client ignores the provided block
type and instead uses the block state in their world.

#### Block Update {#block_update}

Fired whenever a block is changed within the render distance.

```{=mediawiki}
{{Warning2|Changing a block in a chunk that is not loaded is not a stable action.  The Notchian client currently uses a ''shared'' empty chunk which is modified for all block changes in unloaded chunks; while in 1.9 this chunk never renders in older versions the changed block will appear in all copies of the empty chunk.  Servers should avoid sending block changes in unloaded chunks and clients should ignore such packets.}}

#### Set Container Slot {#set_container_slot}

Sent by the server when an item in a slot (in a window) is
added/removed.

  0x14        Play    Client     Window ID    Byte                           The window which is being updated. 0 for player inventory. Note that all known window types include the player inventory. This packet will only be sent for the currently opened window while the player is performing actions, even if it affects the player inventory. After the window is closed, a number of these packets are sent to update the player\'s inventory window (0).
                                 State ID     VarInt                         The last received State ID from either a [Set Container Slot](#Set_Container_Slot "wikilink") or a [Set Container Content](#Set_Container_Content "wikilink") packet

                                 Slot Data    [Slot](Slot_Data "wikilink")   

To set the cursor (the item currently dragged with the mouse), use -1 as
Window ID and as Slot.

This packet can only be used to edit the hotbar and offhand of the
player\'s inventory if window ID is set to 0 (slots 36 through 45) if
the player is in creative, with their inventory open, and not in their
survival inventory tab. Otherwise, when window ID is 0, it can edit any
slot in the player\'s inventory. If the window ID is set to -2, then any
slot in the inventory can be used but no add item animation will be
played.

#### Set Cooldown {#set_cooldown}

Applies a cooldown period to all items with the given type. Used by the
Notchian server with enderpearls. This packet should be sent when the
cooldown starts and also when the cooldown ends (to compensate for lag),
although the client will end the cooldown automatically. Can be applied
to any item, note that interactions still get sent to the server with
the item but the client does not play the animation nor attempt to
predict results (i.e block placing).

#### Plugin Message {#plugin_message}

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Plugin channels}}
```
Mods and plugins can use this to send their data. Minecraft itself uses
several [plugin channels](plugin_channel "wikilink"). These internal
channels are in the `minecraft` namespace.

More information on how it works on [Dinnerbone\'s
blog](https://dinnerbone.com/blog/2012/01/13/minecraft-plugin-channels-messaging/).
More documentation about internal and popular registered channels are
[here](plugin_channel "wikilink").

It appears that Notchian server does not sync world border speed to game ticks, so it gets out of sync with server lag. If the world border is not moving, this is set to 0.
                                 Portal Teleport Boundary   VarInt       Resulting coordinates from a portal teleport are limited to ±value. Usually 29999984.

The Notchian client determines how solid to display the warning by
comparing to whichever is higher, the warning distance or whichever is
lower, the distance from the current diameter to the target diameter or
the place the border will be after warningTime seconds. In pseudocode:

``` java
distance = max(min(resizeSpeed * 1000 * warningTime, abs(targetDiameter - currentDiameter)), warningDistance);
if (playerDistance < distance) {
    warning = 1.0 - playerDistance / distance;
} else {
    warning = 0.0;
}
```

#### Keep Alive {#keep_alive}

The server will frequently send out a keep-alive, each containing a
random ID. The client must respond with the same payload (see
[serverbound Keep Alive](#Keep_Alive_2 "wikilink")). If the client does
not respond to them for over 30 seconds, the server kicks the client.
Vice versa, if the server does not send any keep-alives for 20 seconds,
the client will disconnect and yields a \"Timed out\" exception.

The Notchian server uses a system-dependent time in milliseconds to
generate the keep alive ID value.

This packet sends all block entities in the chunk (though sending them
is not required; it is still legal to send them with [Block Entity

packet is the same format as in the [Update

Note that the Notchian client requires an [Set Center
Chunk](#Set_Center_Chunk "wikilink") packet when it crosses a chunk
border, otherwise it\'ll only display render distance + 2 chunks around
the chunk it spawned in.

The compacted array format has been adjusted so that individual entries
no longer span across multiple longs, affecting the main data array and
heightmaps.

#### World Event {#world_event}

Sent when a client is to play a sound or particle effect.

By default, the Minecraft client adjusts the volume of sound effects
based on distance. The final boolean field is used to disable this, and
instead the effect is played from 2 blocks away in the correct
direction. Currently this is only used for effect 1023 (wither spawn),
effect 1028 (enderdragon death), and effect 1038 (end portal opening);
it is ignored on other effects.

Modifiers can increase or decrease the number of items for the first
input slot. The second input slot and the output slot never change the
nubmer of items. The number of items may never be less than 1, and never
more than the stack size. If special price and demand are both zero,
only the default price is displayed. If either is non-zero, then the
adjusted price is displayed next to the crossed-out default price. The
adjusted prices is calculated as follows:

Adjusted price = default price + floor(default price x multiplier x
demand) + special price

#### Update Entity Position {#update_entity_position}

This packet is sent by the server when an entity moves less then 8
blocks; if an entity moves more than 8 blocks [Teleport
Entity](#Teleport_Entity "wikilink") should be sent instead.

This packet allows at most 8 blocks movement in any direction, because
short range is from -32768 to 32767. And `32768 / (128 * 32)` = 8.

#### Update Entity Position and Rotation {#update_entity_position_and_rotation}

This packet is sent by the server when an entity rotates and moves.
Since a short range is limited from -32768 to 32767, and movement is
offset of fixed-point numbers, this packet allows at most 8 blocks
movement in any direction. (`-32768 / (32 * 128) == -8`)

The Property field looks as in the response of [Mojang API#UUID -\>
Profile + Skin/Cape](Mojang_API#UUID_->_Profile_+_Skin/Cape "wikilink"),
except of course using the protocol format instead of JSON. That is,
each player will usually have one property with Name "textures" and
Value being a base64-encoded JSON string as documented at [Mojang
API#UUID -\> Profile +
Skin/Cape](Mojang_API#UUID_->_Profile_+_Skin/Cape "wikilink"). An empty
properties array is also acceptable, and will cause clients to display
the player with one of the two default skins depending on UUID.

Ping values correspond with icons in the following way:

-   A ping that negative (i.e. not known to the server yet) will result
    in the no connection icon.
-   A ping under 150 milliseconds will result in 5 bars
-   A ping under 300 milliseconds will result in 4 bars
-   A ping under 600 milliseconds will result in 3 bars
-   A ping under 1000 milliseconds (1 second) will result in 2 bars
-   A ping greater than or equal to 1 second will result in 1 bar.

#### Look At {#look_at}

Used to rotate the client player to face the given location or entity
(for
`/teleport [``<targets>`{=html}`] ``<x>`{=html}` ``<y>`{=html}` ``<z>`{=html}` facing`).

treated as if is entity was false.

#### Synchronize Player Position {#synchronize_player_position}

Updates the player\'s position on the server. This packet will also
close the "Downloading Terrain" screen when joining/respawning.

If the distance between the last known position of the player on the
server and the new position set by this packet is greater than 100
meters, the client will be kicked for "You moved too quickly :(
(Hacking?)".

Also if the fixed-point number of X or Z is set greater than `3.2E7D`
the client will be kicked for "Illegal position".

Yaw is measured in degrees, and does not follow classical trigonometry
rules. The unit circle of yaw on the XZ-plane starts at (0, 1) and turns
counterclockwise, with 90 at (-1, 0), 180 at (0, -1) and 270 at (1, 0).
Additionally, yaw is not clamped to between 0 and 360 degrees; any
number is valid, including negative numbers and numbers greater than
360.

Pitch is measured in degrees, where 0 is looking straight ahead, -90 is
looking straight up, and 90 is looking straight down.

#### Respawn

```{=mediawiki}
{{Need Info|Although the number of portal cooldown ticks is included in this packet, the whole portal usage process is still dictated entirely by the server. What kind of effect does this value have on the client, if any?}}
```
To change the player\'s dimension (overworld/nether/end), send them a
respawn packet with the appropriate dimension, followed by
prechunks/chunks for the new dimension, and finally a position and look
packet. You do not need to unload chunks, the client will do it
automatically.

{{Warning2|Avoid changing player's dimension to same dimension they were already in unless they are dead. If you change the dimension to one they are already in, weird bugs can occur, such as the player being unable to attack other players in new world (until they die and respawn).

Before 1.16, if you must respawn a player in the same dimension without killing them, send two respawn packets, one to a different world and then another to the world you want. You do not need to complete the first respawn; it only matters that you send two packets.}}

#### Set Head Rotation {#set_head_rotation}

Changes the direction an entity\'s head is facing.

While sending the Entity Look packet changes the vertical rotation of
the head, sending this packet appears to be necessary to rotate the head
horizontally.

#### Set Camera {#set_camera}

Sets the entity that the player renders from. This is normally used when
the player left-clicks an entity while in spectator mode.

The player\'s camera will move with the entity and look where it is
looking. The entity is often another player, but can be any type of
entity. The player is unable to move this entity (move packets will act
as if they are coming from the other entity).

If the given entity is not loaded by the player, this packet is ignored.
To return control to the player, send this packet with their entity ID.

The Notchian server resets this (sends it back to the default entity)
whenever the spectated entity is killed or the player sneaks, but only
if they were spectating an entity. It also sends this packet whenever
the player switches out of spectator mode (even if they weren\'t
spectating an entity).

-   Creeper → `shaders/post/creeper.json`
-   Spider (and cave spider) → `shaders/post/spider.json`
-   Enderman → `shaders/post/invert.json`
-   Anything else → the current shader is unloaded

#### Set Center Chunk {#set_center_chunk}

```{=mediawiki}
{{Need Info|Why is this even needed?  Is there a better name for it?  My guess is that it's something to do with logical behavior with latency, but it still seems weird.}}
```
Updates the client\'s location. This is used to determine what chunks
should remain loaded and if a chunk load should be ignored; chunks
outside of the view distance may be unloaded.

Sent whenever the player moves across a chunk border horizontally, and
also (according to testing) for any integer change in the vertical axis,
even if it doesn\'t go across a chunk section border.

#### System Chat Message {#system_chat_message}

Identifying the difference between Chat/System Message is important as
it helps respect the user\'s chat visibility options. See [processing
chat](Chat#Processing_chat "wikilink") for more info about these
positions.

#### Pickup Item {#pickup_item}

Sent by the server when someone picks up an item lying on the ground ---
its sole purpose appears to be the animation of the item flying towards
you. It doesn\'t destroy the entity in the client memory, and it
doesn\'t add it to your inventory. The server only checks for items to
be picked up after each [Set Player
Position](#Set_Player_Position "wikilink") (and [Set Player Position And
Rotation](#Set_Player_Position_And_Rotation "wikilink")) packet sent by
the client. The collector entity can be any entity; it does not have to
be a player. The collected entity also can be any entity, but the
Notchian server only uses this for items, experience orbs, and the
different varieties of arrows.

Within flags:

-   0x01: Is ambient - was the effect spawned from a beacon? All
    beacon-generated effects are ambient. Ambient effects use a
    different icon in the HUD (blue border rather than gray). If all
    effects on an entity are ambient, the [\"Is potion effect ambient\"
    living metadata field](Entity_metadata#Living_Entity "wikilink")
    should be set to true. Usually should not be enabled.
-   0x02: Show particles - should all particles from this effect be
    hidden? Effects with particles hidden are not included in the
    calculation of the effect color, and are not rendered on the HUD
    (but are still rendered within the inventory). Usually should be
    enabled.
-   0x04: Show icon - should the icon be displayed on the client?
    Usually should be enabled.

See [Inventory](Inventory "wikilink") for further information about how
slots are indexed.

When right-clicking on a stack of items, half the stack will be picked
up and half left in the slot. If the stack is an odd number, the half
left in the slot will be smaller of the amounts.

The distinct type of click performed by the client is determined by the
combination of the Mode and Button fields.

         1        Normal     Pickup all but check items in reverse order (impossible in vanilla clients)

Starting from version 1.5, "painting mode" is available for use in
inventory windows. It is done by picking up stack of something (more
than 1 item), then holding mouse button (left, right or middle) and
dragging held stack over empty (or same type in case of right button)
slots. In that case client sends the following to server after mouse
button release (omitting first pickup packet which is sent as usual):

1.  packet with mode 5, slot -999, button (0 for left \| 4 for right);
2.  packet for every slot painted on, mode is still 5, button (1 \| 5);
3.  packet with mode 5, slot -999, button (2 \| 6);

If any of the painting packets other than the "progress" ones are sent
out of order (for example, a start, some slots, then another start; or a
left-click in the middle) the painting status will be reset.

#### Close Container {#close_container_1}

This packet is sent by the client when closing a window.

Notchian clients send a Close Window packet with Window ID 0 to close
their inventory even though there is never an [Open
Screen](#Open_Screen "wikilink") packet for the inventory.

Mods and plugins can use this to send their data. Minecraft itself uses
some [plugin channels](plugin_channel "wikilink"). These internal
channels are in the `minecraft` namespace.

                                 Title        Optional String (128 chars)     Title of book.

When editing a draft, the [NBT](NBT "wikilink") section of the Slot
contains this:

    TAG_Compound(<nowiki>''</nowiki>): 1 entry
    {
      TAG_List('pages'): 2 entries
      {
        TAG_String(0): 'Something on Page 1'
        TAG_String(1): 'Something on Page 2'
      }
    }

When signing the book, it instead looks like this:

    TAG_Compound(<nowiki>''</nowiki>): 3 entires
    {
      TAG_String('author'): 'Steve'
      TAG_String('title'): 'A Wonderful Book'
      TAG_List('pages'): 2 entries

#### Interact

This packet is sent from the client to the server when the client
attacks or right-clicks another entity (a player, minecart, etc).

A Notchian server only accepts this packet if the entity being
attacked/used is visible without obstruction and within a 4-unit radius
of the player\'s position.

The target X, Y, and Z fields represent the difference between the
vector location of the cursor at the time of the packet and the
entity\'s position.

Note that middle-click in creative mode is interpreted by the client and
sent as a [Set Creative Mode Slot](#Set_Creative_Mode_Slot "wikilink")
packet instead.

#### Set Player Position {#set_player_position}

Updates the player\'s XYZ position on the server.

Checking for moving too fast is achieved like this:

-   Each server tick, the player\'s current position is stored
-   When a player moves, the changes in x, y, and z coordinates are
    compared with the positions from the previous tick (Δx, Δy, Δz)
-   Total movement distance squared is computed as Δx² + Δy² + Δz²
-   The expected movement distance squared is computed as velocityX² +
    velocityY² + velocityZ²
-   If the total movement distance squared value minus the expected
    movement distance squared value is more than 100 (300 if the player
    is using an elytra), they are moving too fast.

If the player is moving too fast, it will be logged that
\"`<player>`{=html} moved too quickly! \" followed by the change in x,
y, and z, and the player will be teleported back to their current
(before this packet) serverside position.

Also, if the absolute value of X or the absolute value of Z is a value
greater than 3.2×10^7^, or X, Y, or Z are not finite (either positive
infinity, negative infinity, or NaN), the client will be kicked for
"Invalid move player packet received".

#### Set Player Rotation {#set_player_rotation}

![The unit circle for
yaw](Minecraft-trig-yaw.png "The unit circle for yaw") ![The unit circle
of yaw, redrawn](Yaw.png "The unit circle of yaw, redrawn")

Updates the direction the player is looking in.

Yaw is measured in degrees, and does not follow classical trigonometry
rules. The unit circle of yaw on the XZ-plane starts at (0, 1) and turns
counterclockwise, with 90 at (-1, 0), 180 at (0,-1) and 270 at (1, 0).
Additionally, yaw is not clamped to between 0 and 360 degrees; any
number is valid, including negative numbers and numbers greater than
360.

Pitch is measured in degrees, where 0 is looking straight ahead, -90 is
looking straight up, and 90 is looking straight down.

The yaw and pitch of player (in degrees), standing at point (x0, y0, z0)
and looking towards point (x, y, z) can be calculated with:

`dx = x-x0`\
`dy = y-y0`\
`dz = z-z0`\
`r = sqrt( dx*dx + dy*dy + dz*dz )`\
`yaw = -atan2(dx,dz)/PI*180`\
`if yaw < 0 then`\
`    yaw = 360 + yaw`\
`pitch = -arcsin(dy/r)/PI*180`

You can get a unit vector from a given yaw/pitch via:

`x = -cos(pitch) * sin(yaw)`\
`y = -sin(pitch)`\
`z =  cos(pitch) * cos(yaw)`

#### Set Player On Ground {#set_player_on_ground}

This packet as well as [Set Player
Position](#Set_Player_Position "wikilink"), [Set Player
Rotation](#Set_Player_Rotation "wikilink"), and [Set Player Position and
Rotation](#Set_Player_Position_and_Rotation "wikilink") are called the
"serverbound movement packets". Vanilla clients will send Move Player
Position once every 20 ticks even for a stationary player.

This packet is used to indicate whether the player is on ground
(walking/swimming), or airborne (jumping/falling).

When dropping from sufficient height, fall damage is applied when this
state goes from false to true. The amount of damage applied is based on
the point where it last changed from true to false. Note that there are
several movement related packets containing this state.

Right paddle turning is set to true when the left button or forward
button is held, left paddle turning is set to true when the right button
or forward button is held.

#### Pick Item {#pick_item}

Used to swap out an empty space on the hotbar with the item in the given
inventory slot. The Notchian client uses this for pick block
functionality (middle click) to retrieve items from the inventory.

  Packet ID   State   Bound To   Field Name    Field Type   Notes
  ----------- ------- ---------- ------------- ------------ ----------------------------------------
  0x1A        Play    Server     Slot to use   VarInt       See [Inventory](Inventory "wikilink").

The server will first search the player\'s hotbar for an empty slot,
starting from the current slot and looping around to the slot before it.
If there are no empty slots, it will start a second search from the
current slot and find the first slot that does not contain an enchanted
item. If there still are no slots that meet that criteria, then the
server will use the currently selected slot.

After finding the appropriate slot, the server swaps the items and then
send 3 packets:

-   [Set Container Slot](#Set_Container_Slot "wikilink"), with window ID
    set to -2 and slot set to the newly chosen slot and the item set to
    the item that is now in that slot (which was previously at the slot
    the client requested)
-   Set Slot, with window ID set to -2 and slot set to the slot the
    player requested, with the item that is now in that slot and was
    previously on the hotbar slot
-   [Set Held Item](#Set_Held_Item "wikilink"), with the slot set to the
    newly chosen slot.

#### Set Creative Mode Slot {#set_creative_mode_slot}

While the user is in the standard inventory (i.e., not a crafting bench)
in Creative mode, the player will send this packet.

Clicking in the creative inventory menu is quite different from
non-creative inventory management. Picking up an item with the mouse
actually deletes the item from the server, and placing an item into a
slot or dropping it out of the inventory actually tells the server to
create the item from scratch. (This can be verified by clicking an item
that you don\'t mind deleting, then severing the connection to the
server; the item will be nowhere to be found when you log back in.) As a
result of this implementation strategy, the \"Destroy Item\" slot is
just a client-side implementation detail that means \"I don\'t intend to
recreate this item.\". Additionally, the long listings of items (by
category, etc.) are a client-side interface for choosing which item to
create. Picking up an item from such listings sends no packets to the
server; only when you put it somewhere does it tell the server to create
the item in that location.

This action can be described as \"set inventory slot\". Picking up an
item sets the slot to item ID -1. Placing an item into an inventory slot
sets the slot to the specified item. Dropping an item (by clicking
outside the window) effectively sets slot -1 to the specified item,
which causes the server to spawn the item entity, etc.. All other
inventory slots are numbered the same as the non-creative inventory
(including slots for the 2x2 crafting menu, even though they aren\'t
visible in the vanilla client).

should be taken (i.e. the done button).

#### Update Sign {#update_sign}

#### Teleport To Entity {#teleport_to_entity}

Teleports the player to the given entity. The player must be in
spectator mode.

The Notchian client only uses this to teleport to players, but it
appears to accept any type of entity. The entity does not need to be in
the same dimension as the player; if necessary, the player will be
respawned in the right world. If the given entity cannot be found (or
isn\'t loaded), this packet will be ignored. It will also be ignored if
the player attempts to teleport to themselves.

                                 Cursor Position Z   Float         The position of the crosshair on the block, from 0 to 1 increasing from north to south.
                                 Inside block        Boolean       True when the player\'s head is inside of a block.
                                 Sequence            VarInt        

Upon placing a block, this packet is sent once.

The Cursor Position X/Y/Z fields (also known as in-block coordinates)
are calculated using raytracing. The unit corresponds to sixteen pixels
in the default resource pack. For example, let\'s say a slab is being
placed against the south face of a full block. The Cursor Position X
will be higher if the player was pointing near the right (east) edge of
the face, lower if pointing near the left. The Cursor Position Y will be
used to determine whether it will appear as a bottom slab (values
0.0--0.5) or as a top slab (values 0.5-1.0). The Cursor Position Z
should be 1.0 since the player was looking at the southernmost part of
the block.

Inside block is true when a player\'s head (specifically eyes) are
inside of a block\'s collision. In 1.13 and later versions, collision is
rather complicated and individual blocks can have multiple collision
boxes. For instance, a ring of vines has a non-colliding hole in the
middle. This value is only true when the player is directly in the box.
In practice, though, this value is only used by scaffolding to place in
front of the player when sneaking inside of it (other blocks will place
behind when you intersect with them \-- try with glass for instance).

#### Use Item {#use_item}

Sent when pressing the Use Item key (default: right click) with an item
in hand.
